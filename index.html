	<P>&quot;Suffering is a great grace; through suffering the soul becomes like the 
	Savior; in suffering love becomes crystallized; the greater the suffering, the 
	purer the love.&quot; (Diary of St. Faustina, 57)</P>

	<P>&quot;Humiliation is my daily food. I understand that the bride must herself share 
	in everything that is the groom&#39;s; and so His cloak of mockery must cover me, 
	too. At those times when I suffer much, I try to remain silent, as I do not 
	trust my tongue which, at such moments, is inclined to talk for itself, while 
	its duty is to help me praise God for all the blessings and gifts which He has 
	given me. When I receive Jesus in Holy Communion, I ask Him fervently to deign 
	to heal my tongue so that I would offend neither God nor neighbor by it. I want 
	my tongue to praise God without cease. Great are the faults committed by the 
	tongue. The soul will not attain sanctity if it does not keep watch over its 
	tongue.&quot; (92)</P>

	<P>&quot;O you small, everyday sacrifices, you are to me like wild flowers which 
	I strew over the feet of my beloved Jesus. I sometimes compare these trifles 
	to the heroic virtues, and that is because their enduring nature demands heroism.&quot; 
	(208)</P>

	<P>&quot;In the midst of trials I will try to see the loving hand of God. Nothing 
	is as constant as suffering – it always faithfully keeps the soul company. O 
	Jesus, I will let no one surpass me in loving You!&quot; (227)</P>

	<P>&quot;I will thank the Lord Jesus for every humiliation and will pray specially 
	for the person who has given me the chance to be humiliated. I will immolate 
	myself for the benefit of souls. I will not count the cost of any sacrifice. 
	I will cast myself beneath the feet of the sisters, like a carpet on which they 
	can not only tread, but also wipe their feet. My place is under the feet of 
	the sisters. I will make every effort to obtain that place unnoticed by others. 
	It is enough that God sees this.&quot; (243)</P>

	<P>&quot;Jesus told me that I please Him best by meditating on His sorrowful Passion, 
	and by such meditation much light falls upon my soul. He who wants to learn 
	true humility should reflect upon the Passion of Jesus. When I meditate upon 
	the Passion of Jesus, I get a clear understanding of many things I could not 
	comprehend before. I want to resemble You, O Jesus, – You crucified, tortured, 
	and humiliated. Jesus, imprint upon my heart and soul Your own humility. I love 
	You, Jesus, to the point of madness, You who were crushed with suffering as 
	described by the prophet [cf. Isaiah 53:2-9], as if he could not see the human 
	form in You because of Your great suffering. It is in this condition, Jesus, 
	that I love You to the point of madness. O eternal and infinite God, what has 
	love done to You?&quot; (267)</P>

	<P>&quot;From the moment I came to love suffering, it ceased to be a suffering for 
	me. Suffering is the daily food of my soul.&quot; (276)</P>

	<P>&quot;Mother of God, Your soul was plunged into a sea of bitterness; look upon 
	Your child and teach her to suffer and to love while suffering. Fortify my soul 
	that pain will not break it. Mother of grace, teach me to live by [the power 
	of] God.&quot; (315)</P>

	<P>&quot;Suffering is the greatest treasure on earth; it purifies the soul. In suffering, 
	we learn who our true friend is.&quot; (342)</P>

	<P>&quot;True love is measured by the thermometer of suffering. Jesus, I thank You 
	for the little daily crosses, for opposition to my endeavors, for the hardships 
	of communal life, for the misinterpretation of my intentions, for humiliations 
	at the hands of others, for the harsh way in which we are treated, for false 
	suspicions, for poor health and loss of strength, for self-denial, for dying 
	to myself, for lack of recognition in everything, for the upsetting of all my 
	plans. Thank You, Jesus, for interior sufferings, for dryness of spirit, for 
	terrors, fears and incertitudes, for the darkness and the deep interior night, 
	for temptations and various ordeals, for torments too difficult to describe, 
	especially for those which no one will understand, for the hour of death with 
	its fierce struggle and all its bitterness. I thank You, Jesus, You who first 
	drank the cup of bitterness before You gave it to me, in a much milder form. 
	I put my lips to this cup of Your holy will. Let all be done according to Your 
	good pleasure; let that which Your wisdom ordained before the ages be done to 
	me.&quot; (343)</P>

	<P>&quot;Love must be reciprocal. If Jesus tasted the fullness of bitterness for 
	me, then I, His bride, will accept all bitterness as proof of my love for Him.&quot; 
	(389)</P>

	<P>&quot;When some suffering afflicts me, it no longer causes me any bitterness, 
	nor do great consolations carry me away. I am filled with the peace and equanimity 
	that flow from the knowledge of the truth. How can living surrounded by unfriendly 
	hearts do me any harm when I enjoy full happiness within my soul? Or, how can 
	having kind hearts around me help me when I do not have God within me? When 
	God dwells within me, who can harm me?&quot; (455)</P>

	<P>&quot;I accept joy or suffering, praise or humiliation with the same disposition. 
	I remember that one and the other are passing. What does it matter to me what 
	people say about me? I have long ago given up everything that concerns my person. 
	My name is host – or sacrifice, not in words but in deeds, in the emptying of 
	myself and in becoming like You on the Cross, O Good Jesus, my Master!&quot; (485)</P>

	<P>&quot;I will enclose myself in the chalice of Jesus so that I may comfort Him 
	continually. I will do everything within my power to save souls, and I will 
	do it through prayer and suffering.&quot; (735)</P>

	<P>&quot;I have understood that at certain and most difficult moments I shall be 
	alone, deserted by everyone, and that I must face all the storms and fight with 
	all the strength of my soul, even with those from whom I expected to get help. 
	But I am not alone, because Jesus is with me, and with Him I fear nothing. I 
	am well aware of everything, and I know what God is demanding of me. Suffering, 
	contempt, ridicule, persecution, and humiliation will be my constant lot. I 
	know no other way. For sincere love – ingratitude; this is my path, marked out 
	by the footprints of Jesus.&quot; (746)</P>

	<P>&quot;In difficult moments, I will fix my gaze upon the silent Heart of Jesus, 
	stretched upon the Cross, and from the exploding flames of His merciful Heart, 
	will flow down upon me power and strength to keep fighting.&quot; (906)</P>

	<P>&quot;Oh, if only the suffering soul knew how it is loved by God, it would die 
	of joy and excess of happiness! Some day, we will know the value of suffering, 
	but then we will no longer be able to suffer. The present moment is ours.&quot; (963)</P>

	<P>&quot;May You be blessed, O God, for everything You send me. Nothing under the 
	sun happens without Your will. I cannot penetrate Your secrets with regard to 
	myself, but I press my lips to the chalice You offer me.&quot; (1208)</P>

	<P>&quot;My God, although my sufferings are great and protracted, I accept them from 
	Your hands as magnificent gifts. I accept them all, even the ones that other 
	souls have refused to accept. You can come to me with everything, my Jesus; 
	I will refuse You nothing. I ask You for only one thing: give me the strength 
	to endure them and grant that they may be meritorious. Here is my whole being; 
	do with me as You please.&quot; (1795)</P>
